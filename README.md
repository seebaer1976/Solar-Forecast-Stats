## Important Compatibility Notes

> **Warning**
> This integration does NOT work on:
> - **Raspberry Pi** — Due to performance limitations with matplotlib chart generation
> - **Proxmox VE** — When Home Assistant runs directly on Proxmox (VMs/LXC containers on Proxmox are fine)

**Recommended platforms:**
- Intel NUC or similar x86 hardware
- Virtual machines with adequate resources (4GB+ RAM)
- LXC containers on Proxmox with sufficient allocation
- Home Assistant OS on capable hardware

---

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. HACS > Integrations > Custom repositories
2. Add `https://github.com/Zara-Toorox/sfml_stats` (Integration category)
3. Install **SFML Stats**
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > SFML Stats

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Copy the `sfml_stats` folder to `custom_components/` in your Home Assistant config directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > SFML Stats

## Sensor Configuration Guide

### General Notes

All sensors are optional. The integration works with incomplete configuration but will only display available data.

Power sensors can be specified in Watts (W) or Kilowatts (kW). The integration detects the unit automatically. Energy sensors should be in Kilowatt-hours (kWh).

### Step 1: Basic Settings

No sensors required. Configuration options for automatic chart generation and color theme selection.

### Step 2: Energy Flow Sensors

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sensor_solar_power` | W | Current total PV output |
| `sensor_solar_to_house` | W | Solar power consumed directly |
| `sensor_solar_to_battery` | W | Solar power flowing into battery |
| `sensor_grid_to_house` | W | Power drawn from grid |
| `sensor_grid_to_battery` | W | Grid power charging battery |
| `sensor_house_to_grid` | W | Power fed into grid |
| `sensor_smartmeter_import` | kWh | Total grid consumption (smart meter) |
| `sensor_smartmeter_export` | kWh | Total export (smart meter) |

### Step 3: Battery Sensors

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sensor_battery_soc` | % | Battery state of charge |
| `sensor_battery_power` | W | Charging/discharging power |
| `sensor_battery_to_house` | W | Discharge power to house |
| `sensor_battery_to_grid` | W | Discharge power to grid |
| `sensor_home_consumption` | W | Total household consumption |

### Step 4: Statistics Sensors

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sensor_solar_yield_daily` | kWh | Daily PV yield (midnight reset) |
| `sensor_grid_import_daily` | kWh | Daily grid consumption |
| `sensor_grid_import_yearly` | kWh | Yearly grid consumption |
| `sensor_battery_charge_solar_daily` | kWh | Daily battery charge from solar |
| `sensor_battery_charge_grid_daily` | kWh | Daily battery charge from grid |
| `sensor_price_total` | EUR | Total cost for grid consumption |
| `weather_entity` | — | Weather entity for chart annotations |

### Step 5: Panel Sensors (up to 4 groups)

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `panel_name` | Text | Custom name (e.g., South, East) |
| `sensor_panel_power` | W | Current string power output |
| `sensor_panel_max_today` | W | Peak power reached today |

### Step 6: Billing

No sensors required. Configure billing period start, price mode (dynamic/fixed), and feed-in tariff.

## Practical Tips

### Creating Missing Sensors

**Daily counters:** Use the Utility Meter helper with daily reset.
**Maximum values:** Use the Statistics helper with the Maximum function.
**Calculated values:** Create a Template sensor.

### Typical Sensor Sources

| Manufacturer | Integration |
|--------------|-------------|
| Fronius | Native integration |
| SMA | Modbus or SMA Energy Meter |
| Huawei | FusionSolar or Modbus |
| Kostal | Piko or Plenticore |
| Growatt | Growatt Server |
| Sungrow | Modbus |
| Enphase | Envoy integration |

### Template Sensor for Home Consumption

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Home Consumption"
        unit_of_measurement: "W"
        state: >
          {{ states('sensor.solar_power')|float(0)
             + states('sensor.grid_import')|float(0)
             - states('sensor.grid_export')|float(0) }}
```
